# Documentation Update Rule

When making changes that affect the plugin's functionality or user-facing features, ensure that the following documentation files are reviewed and updated accordingly:

1.  **`README.md`**: This file provides a general overview, installation instructions, and basic usage examples. Update this file to reflect any changes in commands, options, or overall behavior.
2.  **`doc/ogpmd.txt`**: This file contains the Vim help documentation. Update the command descriptions, options, and any relevant sections to accurately describe the current functionality.
3.  **Language**: Both `README.md` and `doc/unfurl.txt` should be written in English.

Keeping the documentation consistent with the code is crucial for users to understand and effectively use the plugin.
